<h2>FET Basics</h2>
<p>Field-Effect Transistor (FET) is a semiconductor device that consists of a channel made of a semiconductor material, with two electrodes connected at either end, namely the drain and the source. The flow of current between the source and the drain terminals is controlled by a third electrode, known as the gate, which is placed in close proximity to the channel. By applying a voltage at the gate terminal, the number of charge carriers in the channel can be modulated, leading to a corresponding change in the current flow between the source and the drain terminals. The FET is classified into two types based on its mode of operation, namely the enhancement mode and depletion mode FETs, depending on whether the voltage applied at the gate terminal increases or decreases the current flow through the channel.</p>
<div id="fet-working">
<h2>FET Working</h2>
<p> When a voltage is applied to the gate electrode, an electric field is created across the insulating layer, which in turn creates a depletion region in the channel. The depletion region reduces the number of free charge carriers in the channel, and thus the conductivity of the channel is reduced. This effect is known as the field-effect, and it is the basis of the FET operation. In the case of an n-type FET, a negative voltage applied to the gate electrode creates a depletion region in the channel, which reduces the flow of electrons from the source to the drain. In contrast, a positive voltage applied to the gate electrode of a p-type FET creates a depletion region that reduces the flow of holes from the source to the drain. Thus, by varying the voltage applied to the gate electrode, the conductivity of the channel can be controlled, and the flow of current through the FET can be modulated. </p>
<p>To explain the working principle of FET, the analogy of a water pipe and vessel can be used. In this analogy, the source of water can be considered as the source terminal of FET, while the vessel that collects water can be analogous to the drain terminal of FET. The gate terminal can be compared to the controlling tap that regulates the flow of water. Similar to how the tap modulates the flow of water, the voltage applied at the gate terminal controls the flow of current from the source to the drain terminal of FET. Thus, the FET operates by controlling the flow of current through the channel by modulating the number of charge carriers in the channel using the voltage applied at the gate terminal.</p>

<h2>History of FET Transistor</h2>
<p> Julius Edgar Lilienfeld was the first to file a patent for a field-effect transistor in 1926, however, his device faced significant technical challenges that hindered its practical application. The design of Lilienfeld’s device relied on a thin metal film as a gate, which was deposited onto a semiconductor substrate. Unfortunately, the quality of the metal-to-semiconductor contact was poor, resulting in high resistance and low device efficiency. Additionally, the insulating layer used in Lilienfeld’s device was unstable, making it unsuitable for high-voltage applications. Therefore, there was a need to improve the device design to overcome these limitations and make it practical for real-world applications. In 1934, Oskar Heil also filed a patent for a similar device. Oskar Heil’s device was not rejected per se, but it was not as successful as Lilienfeld’s device in practical implementation. Lilienfeld’s device used a thin layer of metal oxide to form the gate of the transistor, while Heil’s device used a metal-semiconductor junction. The metal-semiconductor junction was more difficult to produce and control than the metal oxide layer, which limited the practicality of Heil’s device.</p>
<p>Additionally, Heil’s device was not widely known or recognized at the time, and it was only after the development of the junction transistor by Shockley and his team at Bell Labs that the potential of field-effect transistors was fully realized. Nonetheless, Heil’s contributions to developing FETs were significant, and his work paved the way for later technological advancements. However, the first working field-effect transistor, called the junction gate field-effect transistor, was developed by William Shockley and his team at Bell Labs in 1947. Shockley and his colleagues John Bardeen and Walter Brattain were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 for inventing the junction transistor, which included the junction gate field-effect transistor as a key component. Since then, field-effect transistor technology has undergone significant developments, making it one of the most important electronic components of the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>

<h3><strong>Essential Information concerning FETs</strong></h3>

<p>Field-effect transistors (FETs) can be classified into two types: majority carrier devices, where the current is carried primarily by the majority carriers, and minority carrier devices, where the current flow is primarily due to the minority carriers. In FETs, electrons flow from the source to the drain through active channels in the device, and ohmic contacts connect both the terminal conductors to the semiconductor material. The source terminal and the
